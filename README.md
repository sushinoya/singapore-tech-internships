# Singapore Tech Internships!

All positions are Software Engineering roles, unless otherwise specified in the Notes column. Similarly, all positions are open to anyone enrolled in a Bachelor's degree program, unless specific graduation years are mentioned in the Notes column. Some links here are invalid since they were for Summer 2021. Companies are slowly opening up applications for Summer 2022 and the links will be updated as those positions open.

**Note:** Internship details listed here are for mostly for Summer 2021/2022, and are accurate as of the time of writing. Some companies do not have a website dedicated for recruitment or internship applications. Some others do not have internship positions listed on their recruitment page although they do accept interns, or may update their openings at a later time.
